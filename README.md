# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is help Louise analyse the data from her project campaign, in order to take note of trends of each campaign and visualize their outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. The analysis is help Louise to see how the launched dates and fundraising goals affected the success, failure or cancellation of the theatre campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze the theatre outcomes based on launch date, a pivot table was created were launch date was the x-axis and the y-axis was outcomes. Using the pivot table, a line graph was created to visualize the piece of data and make it easier to read. From the table, we can see that out of 1393 campaigns, 839 campaigns were successful. From the graph, it is clear that the month of May has the highest number of successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns. December has the lowest number of successful campaigns, while November has the lowest rate of failed campaigns. It is evident that there are only three months which had live campaigns: January, February and March. For the month of October, there was no cancelled campaign. This can be seen in the chart![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch_Table](resources/Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch_dates_Table.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A seperate spreadsheet was created to analyze the theatre outcomes based on the fundraising goals. Using the spreasheet, a line graph was created to visualize the data. It is clear that campaigns with low fundraising goals had the highest success percentage, which is seen for goals with less than 1000 and goals with 1000 to 4999. Campaigns that had goals of 5000 to 9999, 10000 to 14999 and 15000 to 19999 have roughly the same success percentage. After that there was a gradual decrease in success percentage till the goal 25000 to 29999 where it gradually increased and it platued at goals 35000 to 34999 and 40000 to 44999. Campaigns with goals of 45000 to 49999 had success percetage of 0. This can be seen in the chart and table ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) ![Outcomes_vs_Goals_Table](resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals_Table.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Using Excel to work with large data set can be tasking and difficult to keep up with, especially working multiple spreadsheets created. It can be a bit challenging having to ensure the you are using the right formulas for each column, becuase if there is any error it can skew the visualization of the data.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Conclusively, May is best time to launch play because it has the highest success rate. December has the lowest number of successful campaigns so it would not be a good time to launch a campaign. June, July and August had roughly the same amount of failed theatre outcomes.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
This shows that campaigns with higher fundraising goals have lower success percentage. Campaigns with fundraising goal of 15000 to 19999 had 50 percent chance of both success and failure. It is clear that campaigns with low fundraising goals had the highest success percentage.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The theatre outcomes were not compared other factors such as the country, which may affect the success rate of some campaigns. In addition, deadlines of the campaign may also affect the success rate, which can be looked into and analyzed.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Possible tables and graphs can focus on theatre outcomes based on country to see the trends of success, failed and canceled campaigns across each country. Another analysis can be outcomes based on the deadlines of each campaign.
